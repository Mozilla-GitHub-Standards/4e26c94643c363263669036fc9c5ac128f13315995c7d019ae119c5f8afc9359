# Mozilla's cross-browser testing lab

This repository holds a tutorial intended to help web developers learn how to
detect cross-browser issues using Sauce Labs. The tutorial can be found at
[Mozilla's cross-browser testing lab](https://github.com/mdn/crossbrowser-testing-lab/wiki#mozillas-cross-browser-testing-lab)
on this repository's wiki.

The repository may eventually contain code samples, other markdown files, or
web assets for building a static web site from the content.

## Introduction to Automated Testing on MDN Web Docs

Another great cross-browser tutorial can be found at [Introduction to Automated Testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Automated_testing#Using_Sauce_Labs_to_speed_up_browser_testing) on MDN Web Docs.  The tutorial includes
an introduction to task runners and commercial browser test automation apps to
help reduce the tedious and error prone nature of manually testing web apps.

## Additional Cross Browser Testing Documentation

For additional cross-browser documentation, please see the
[Cross Browser Testing Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing)
on MDN Web Docs.

The module includes a number of guides that allow you to explore testing web apps
across different browsers.  It looks at strategies for identifying your target
audience, how to approach testing, the main issues faced with different types of
code and how to mitigate them.  Additionally, the module includes an overview of
tools that are most useful to help you test and fix problems, and how to use
automation to speed up your testing.
